# Two-Factor Authentication with Authy REST APIs

Here you will learn how to use the Authy REST APIs to perform the user registration, send SMS, place a voice call, verify the token, etc.


[Learn more about the Authy REST APIs](http://docs.authy.com/).

## Quickstart

### Create an Authy app

Create a free [Authy account](https://www.authy.com/developers/) if you don't
have one already, and then connect it to your Twilio account.

### Running the sample scripts

Each one of these scripts is designed to run independently and perform the designated functionality specified on its file name.

1. First clone this repository and `cd` into it

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:mjabali/Authy-API-Samples.git
   $ cd Authy-API-Samples
   ```

1. Update the .api.env with your user/environment/API information and then load the variables into your environment.
If you are using a UNIX operating system, just use the source command to load the variables into your environment.

```bash
$ source .api.env
```

If you are using a different operating system, make sure that all the variables from the .api.env file are loaded into your environment.
